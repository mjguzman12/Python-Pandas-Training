The Omnidroid pulls its limb out of the cliff and leaped high into the air, intent on crushing Mr. Incredible, who leaped out of the way and landed in the lava fields. The Omnidroid lands and makes an attempt to push Mr. Incredible into the lava as he tried to push back. After a few seconds however, he lets out a scream while using his maximum strength and jerk-pulls the robot aside into the lava.]",The Incredibles
"[He then jack-knives, ripping the claw off its arms. He runs under the robot, as it uses his lower sensor cluster. Just as it spots its target, he rips it off, and climbs inside the robot, as it unintentionally starts damaging itself. After a while, it stops, weakened. Mr. Incredible punched off its upper sensor cluster, as it whistles while riding the robot. The robot tries to pull him out, but it accidentally tears its brainpan out. Mr. Incredible jumps out of the robot and casually walks away, as the Omnidroid motionlessly falls down.]",The Incredibles

"[Helen stretches out her arm and punches both guards until one of the guards presses a button to shut the door, trapping Helen's arm. Helen feels around one guard's shoulder and torso, before reaching his face and punching him out, even with her arm trapped. Another guard two doors behind them notices the stuck leg and knows that something is up. Meanwhile, two more guards traveling on a saucer down the hall are unknowingly clotheslined by Helen's midsection. Those two guards collect themselves and aim their guns at her while the third guard just nudges the leg. Helen scoffs and then delivers one swift kick with the stuck leg, knocking that guard out and causing his gun to fire uncontrollably. One of those gunshots fire into the control panel, unlocking the door and freeing her leg, while in one swift motion, Helen nails both of the other guards into the door, knocking them out with her legs. Helen reaches the ID card in one guard's belt inside the door where her arm is trapped, reaches the control panel to open the door and free her arm. She then stretches out the arm to activate the other control panel, opening the door and freeing her. Helen then exhales and runs forward offscreen. Cut to outside the building as Helen loads the knocked-out guards into the inside of the building and closes the panel, locking them in.]",The Incredibles
