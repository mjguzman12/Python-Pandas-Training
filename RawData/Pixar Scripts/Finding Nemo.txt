[Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar opening credits]

[The camera fades into a shot of the deep ocean. A vast empty blue void. Anything could be out there.]

MARLIN: Wow.

CORAL: Mm...

MARLIN: Wow.

CORAL: Mmmhmm...

[A pair of clownfish, Marlin and his mate Coral, look out from their tranquil anemone home on the Great Barrier Reef. It rests on the cliff face of the Drop-off, where the shallow water falls steeply to the deep. Light dances over everything as it sways with the rhythm of the undercurrent.]

MARLIN: Wow.

CORAL: Yes, Marlin. No, I see it. It's... beautiful.

MARLIN: So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think you were going to get the whole ocean view, did you? Huh? [swims out of the anemone, before breathing deeply] Oh yeah. A fish can breathe out here! Did your man deliver? Or did he deliver?

[Coral rolls her eyes and smiles]

CORAL: My man delivered.

MARLIN: And it wasn't so easy.

CORAL: Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place...

MARLIN: You better believe they did! Every single one of them.

CORAL: Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome.

[Coral steers Marlin's focus back to the coral reef, where their neighbors, an array of multi-colored marine life, happily go about their business amidst the exotic foliage that blankets the reef. Marlin soaks it in and turns to Coral, who seems concerned]

MARLIN: So you do like it, don't you?

CORAL: No, no, no. I do. I do. I really do like it. [leads him out to the edge] But Marlin, I know the Drop-off is desirable with the great schools and the amazing view and all that. But do we really need so much space?

MARLIN: Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look, look... [swims into the anemone, before acting it out] They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they see a whale passing right by their bedroom window!

CORAL: Shhh... You're going to wake the kids.

MARLIN: Oh right. Right.

[Marlin follows Coral down to a small grotto in the rock below. They peek in at a bed of fish eggs nestled within the rock. The nuclei of the eggs quiver at random]

CORAL: Aw, look. They're dreaming.

[Marlin and Coral, soon to be parents, lovingly observe their babies from the entrance of the grotto.]

CORAL: We still have to name them.

?MARLIN: You want to name all of them, right now? All right, we'll name, uh, this half Marlin Jr., and then this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done.

[Marlin swims out of the grotto.]

CORAL: [ignores Marlin] I like Nemo.

[Upon hearing what Coral just said, Marlin then swims back to the grotto.]

MARLIN: Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo, but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

CORAL: Just think, in a couple of days, we’re going to be parents.

MARLIN: Yeah... but what if they don't like me?

[Coral, having heard this before, leaves the grotto and swims back to the anemone. Marlin also leaves the grotto.]

CORAL: Marlin...

MARLIN: No, really.

CORAL: There's over four-hundred eggs. Odds are one of them is bound to like you.

[Coral goes inside the anemone, before settling on the anemone floor. She turns to find Marlin staring at her through the tendrils.]

CORAL: What?

MARLIN: You remember how we met?

CORAL: Well, I try not to.

MARLIN: Well, I remember.

[Marlin chases Coral around the inside of the anemone, threatening to kiss her.]

MARLIN: Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?

CORAL: [laughing] No, no! Get away! Marlin!

MARLIN: Well, you got to look a little closer because it's wiggling.

CORAL: Get away! Get away!

[Coral manages to swim outside of the anemone, but Marlin is right behind.]

MARLIN: There he is! Cutie's here!

[Marlin pokes out of the anemone and is startled to noticed some rather unusual activity going on from outside the anemone. As a matter of fact, there seemed to be little activity at all. The whole neighborhood seemed eerily empty, except for one last fish finding shelter in one of the bits of coral, as if some strange force was coming after them.]

MARLIN: Where did everybody go?

[Upon turning around, Marlin notices a motionless Coral, as well as a hungry barracuda, floating in the mirk, staring the two fish down. Marlin tries to whisper without moving.]

MARLIN: Coral, get inside the house, Coral.

[Marlin catches Coral glancing down at the eggs in the grotto.]

MARLIN: No. No, Coral. Don't. They'll be fine. Just get inside. You. Right now.

[Ignoring Marlin's order to hide, Coral swims down to the grotto to protect her eggs, as the barracuda charges against her.]

MARLIN: No! Ow!

[Marlin swims down and attempts to save Coral, but instead collides with the barracuda ? its jaws snap ? he dodges and slams into it again ? the barracuda's tail smacks him hard against the rock wall. Marlin falls limp into the anemone as the camera quickly fades into darkness.]

[The camera fades in on the anemone tendrils, swaying gently with the current. Marlin regains consciousness and quickly gets up.]

MARLIN: Coral!

[Marlin swims from the anemone and scans the darkness, only to see nothing but a vast empty dark blue void. He looks down and moves cautiously towards the moonlight grotto.]

MARLIN: Coral?

[Marlin looks inside the grotto, only to discover that it is empty. He then swims out of the grotto, looking for Coral.]

MARLIN: (gasps in sadness) Coral?

[Marlin then begins to realize the shocking truth: Coral and their eggs... are gone.]

MARLIN: No... no...

[Marlin swims aimlessly. All alone. Stunned. When he looks down, and notices a single fish egg lying exposed on the sand, quivering on a ledge below the grotto. Marlin gasps and swims towards the egg.]

MARLIN: There, there. It's okay, Daddy's here. Daddy's got you.

[Marlin gently cradles the egg in his fins and turns it over. The other side of the egg is revealed to be scarred, but intact.]

MARLIN: I promise, I will never let anything happen to you... Nemo.

[The camera cuts to a shot of the full moon from underneath the water's rippling surface as the opening credits play. Camera dissolves to the bright morning sun replacing the moon as we pull back inside the anemone home. Title: Finding Nemo.]

[A little clownfish named Nemo pops into the frame.]

NEMO: First day of school! First day of school! Wake up! Wake up! C'mon, first day of school!

[Nemo then jumps on top of Marlin, who is asleep on the anemone floor.]

MARLIN: [asleep] I don't want to go to school ? five more minutes.

NEMO: Not you, Dad, me! Get up! Get up!

[Nemo is so excited he swims across the anemone, just as Marlin slowly begins to wake up to see Nemo swimming across the anemone.]

MARLIN: Okay. Huh?

NEMO: Get up, get up!

MARLIN: I'm up... what is it?

NEMO: It's time for school!

MARLIN: All right, I’m up. It's time for school.

NEMO: It's time for school! Time for school! Time for school! Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh boy! [Nemo loses control and tumbles out of the anemone.] Whoa!

MARLIN: Nemo!

[Marlin bursts out of the anemone to find Nemo stuck, face first, in a vase coral.]

NEMO: [muffled; still excited] First day of school!

MARLIN: Nemo, don't move! Don't move! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it.

[In an anxious fervor, Marlin pops Nemo out of the vase coral, rushes him back inside, and frantically checks him all over.]

MARLIN: All right, where's the break? You feel a break?

NEMO: [calmly] No.

MARLIN: Sometimes you can't tell because fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids?

NEMO: No.

MARLIN: Are you woozy?

NEMO: No.

MARLIN: How many stripes do I have?

NEMO: I'm fine.

MARLIN: Answer the stripe question!

NEMO: Three.

MARLIN: No! See, something’s wrong with you. I have one... [checks himself to see whether he has three stripes or not, and calms down upon noticing that he has three stripes] two, three? That's all I have? Oh, you're okay. How's the lucky fin?

[Nemo then shows Marlin his right pectoral fin, noticeably smaller than his other fin. Whenever he is swimming, Nemo has to flap it twice as fast, like a hummingbird, in order to stay balanced.]

NEMO: Lucky.

MARLIN: Let's see.

[Nemo awkwardly slaps his dad five with the withered fin.]

MARLIN: Are you sure you wanna go to school this year? Because there is no problem if you don't. You can wait five or ? six years.

NEMO: Come on, Dad. It's time for school!

MARLIN: Ah-ah-ah! Forgot to brush.

NEMO: Oh.

MARLIN: Do you want this anemone to sting you?

NEMO: [looks at it] Yes.

MARLIN: Brush.

[Nemo gives a brief perfunctory graze against the tendrils.]

NEMO: Okay, I'm done!

MARLIN: Uh, you missed a spot!

NEMO: Where?

MARLIN: There.

[Marlin begins to tickle Nemo, who begins laughing as a result.]

MARLIN: [continued] And right there. And here and here!

[Marlin pokes his head out of the anemone, tentatively. Nemo does the same. This anemone is a new home, resting in the center of an isolated cul de sac deep inside the reef, nice and safe.]

MARLIN: Alright. We're excited. First day of school. Here we go. We're ready to learn, to get some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the oceans?

NEMO: It's not safe.

MARLIN: That's my boy. So... first we check to see that the coast is clear... we go out...

[Marlin ventures out halfway, before pulling right back into the anemone. He then proceeds to repeat this routine ad nauseum.]

MARLIN: [continued] ...and back in. And then we go out... and back in. And then one more time, out... and back in. And sometimes, if you want to do it four times ?

NEMO: Dad...

MARLIN: Alright, come on, boy.

[Impatient, Nemo heads out. Marlin dotes his son's progress as they swim through the coral.]

NEMO: Dad, maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark!

MARLIN: I highly doubt that.

NEMO: Have you ever met a shark?

MARLIN: No, and I don't plan to.

NEMO: How old are sea turtles?

MARLIN: Sea turtles? I ? I don't know...

NEMO: Sandy Plankton from next door... he said that sea turtles, they live to be about a hundred years old!

MARLIN: Well, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking to the shark, okay? [grabs onto Nemo] Whoa, whoa! Hold on. Wait to cross.

[Marlin pulls Nemo back from an intersection of streaming fish. A red crossing guard fish stops the traffic, and allows them to cross over.]

MARLIN: Hold my fin, hold my fin.

NEMO: Dad, you're not going to freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?

MARLIN Hey, that snail was about to charge.

[The two clownfish travel to a large patch of sand ? the schoolyard. Chaos reigns as children of many marine species run around playing while their relaxed parents talk and laugh in large groups. Marlin nervously holds tight to Nemo.]

MARLIN: Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go.

[Marlin and Nemo swim by a large fish, who opens her mouth, allowing all of her kids to come out.]

KIDS IN MOUTH: Bye, Mom!

LARGE FISH MOM: I'll pick you up after school.

[The camera cuts to two bratty fish children playing keep-away with a young hermit crab's shell.]

YOUNG HERMIT CRAB: Come on, you guys. Stop it. Give it back.

[Marlin tentatively weaves through the crowds, still holding tight onto Nemo.]

MARLIN: Come on, we'll try over there.

[Marlin and Nemo swim towards a trio of laughing fathers, consisting of the seahorse Bob, the butterfly fish Phil, and the flapjack octopus Ted.]

Marlin: Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?

BOB: Well, look who's out of the anemone.

MARLIN: Yes. Shocking, I know.

BOB: Marty, right?

MARLIN: Marlin.

BOB: Bob.

TED: Ted.

BILL: Bill. [upon realizing that Marlin is a clownfish] Hey! You're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Hey, tell us a joke.

MARLIN: Well, actually that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish.

BILL: Aw, c'mon, clowny.

TED: Yeah, do somethin' funny.

BOB: Yeah!

MARLIN: Well, alright, I ? I know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see, and he walks up to a sea ? well, he doesn't walk up, he swims up.

[As Marlin butchers the joke, the three fathers' eager expressions slowly deflate.]

MARLIN: [continued] Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place and then the sea cucumber ? well they... I'm mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber, none of them were walking, so forget that I said that ?

BOB: [angry] Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johannsen's yard, now!

[Nearby, a trio of children, consisting of the seahorse Sheldon, the butterfly fish Tad, and the flapjack octopus Pearl, laugh as they jump up and down on the sand. They scream in surprise as Mr. Johannsen, a giant flounder with both eyes on one side of his body, bursts from under the sand. The trio then hides behind Mr. Johannsen's blind side as he searches in vain.]

MR. JOHANNSEN: All right, you kids! Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

NEMO: [whispers excitedly to Marlin] Dad, can I go play too? Can I?

MARLIN: I would feel better if you'd go play over on the sponge beds.

[Cut to a shot of the sponge beds, where baby fish bounce with their mothers close by. One falls over, wails loudly. Nemo looks at his dad: "You've got to be kidding."]

MARLIN: [continued] That's where I would play.

[Tad, Sheldon, and Pearl crowd around Nemo.]

PEARL: What's wrong with his fin?

TAD: He looks funny!

[Not Tad, but Sheldon is smacked by his father.]

SHELDON: Ow! Hey! Whaddido? Whaddido?

BOB: Be nice. It's his first time at school.

MARLIN: He was born with it, kids... we call it his lucky fin.

NEMO: Dad...

PEARL: See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all of my other tentacles but you can't really tell. [begins twirling] Especially when I twirl them like this.

SHELDON: I'm H2O-intolerant.

[Sheldon sneezes, and is propelled further from Nemo.]

TAD: I'm obnoxious.

[Distant singing stops the kids, who wheel around to see a white-spotted eagle ray sailing into the schoolyard.]

MR. RAY: Oh! Let's name the zones, the zones? The zones! Let's name the zones of the open sea!

KIDS: Mr. Ray!

SHELDON: Come on, Nemo.

[As the trio heads off, Marlin holds Nemo back.]

MARLIN: Whoa. You better stay with me.

[Not just Pearl, Sheldon, and Tad, but the other kids excluding Nemo rush over to Mr. Ray.]

MR. RAY: There's epilagic, mesopolagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic and all the rest are too deep for you and me to see!

[Mr. Ray then lands right on top of the waiting children.]

MR. RAY: [mock concern] Huh. I wonder where my class has gone.

[Mr. Ray then slightly lifts one of his wings to reveal the children.]

KIDS: We're under here! We're under here!

MR. RAY: Oh, there you are! Climb aboard, explorers!

[Mr. Ray drops one of his wings to allow the children to board him.]

MR. RAY: [sings] Oh, knowledge exploring is oh so lyrical, when you think thoughts that are empirical.

[Nemo is the last to board Mr. Ray, with Marlin nearby.]

NEMO: [to Marlin] Dad, you can go now ?

MR. RAY: Well, hello. Who is this?

NEMO: I'm Nemo.

MR. RAY: Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.

NEMO: Okay.

MR. RAY: You live in what kind of home?

NEMO: In an anemonene... amanemone... ammeneme... anemo ?

MR. RAY: Okay, okay, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorer!

MARLIN: [aside to Mr. Ray] Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him take a break. Ten, fifteen minutes ?

NEMO: [from the back] Dad, it's time for you to go now.

MR. RAY: Don't worry, we're going to stay together as a group.

[Mr. Ray begins to sail out of the schoolyard, with all of the children boarding him.]

MR. RAY: Okay, class, optical orbits up front and remember: we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves. That means you, Jimmy.

JIMMY: Aw, man!

[As Mr. Ray continues singing as he is sailing out of the school yard with the class, Marlin trails behind.]

MARLIN: Bye, Nemo!

NEMO: Bye, Dad!

MARLIN: Bye, son!

[Marlin then anxiously watches Mr. Ray and the class disappear into the open sea.]

MARLIN: [under breath] Be safe.

[The fathers then gather around Marlin, who tries to feign an air of indifference.]

BOB: Hey, you're doin' pretty well for a first-timer.

MARLIN: Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you?

BILL: I had a tough time when my oldest went out on the Drop-off.

MARLIN: They just got to grow up sometime ? the Drop-off??? They're going to the Drop-off?! What are you, insane?! Why don't we fry them up now and serve them with chips?!

BOB: Hey, Marty, calm down!

MARLIN: Don't tell me to be calm, Pony Boy!

[Marlin frantically swims after the class. The other fathers just float there, stunned.]

BOB: Pony Boy?

BILL: You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.

TED: [shakes head] Pity.

[As Mr. Ray glides through the reef, Nemo and the class take in all the wondrous sights.]

MR. RAY: [singing] Oh, let's name the species, the species, the species. Let's name the species that live in the sea. There’s porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three! Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma, and some fish like you and me. Come on, sing with me. Oh...

NEMO: [in awe] Cool...

MR. RAY: Just the girls this time. [continues singing] Oh, seaweed is cool. Seaweed is fun. It makes it's food with the rays of the sun...

[Mr. Ray dives down and sails above some seaweed. As a fish swims by the camera, we cut to Mr. Ray settling on a sandy patch as the cheering kids tumble off his back.]

MR. RAY: Okay, the Drop-off. Alright, kids, feel free to explore but stay close ? [gasps] Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather!

[The class gathers around Mr. Ray as he scrutinizes a tiny floating particle.]

MR. RAY: An entire ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck! There are as many protein pairs contained in this one bacteria as all the grains of sand in the entire ocean.

[Tad privately nudges Pearl and Sheldon.]

TAD: Come on, let's go.

MR. RAY: Come on, sing with me! [sings] There's porifera, coelentera, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three. Mollusca and gastropoda, arthropoda...

[Nemo catches sight of Tad, Pearl, and Sheldon sneaking away. Curious, he follows after them through the brush-like coral polyp, out the other side.]

NEMO: Hey guys, wait up!

[Nemo stops at the edge of the Drop-off. The reef falls sharply into the open waters of the deep: an empty ominous blue void. Anything could be out there. All four kids are riveted on the murky depths.]

NEMO: [continued] Cool...

TAD: Saved your life!

[Tad pushes Pearl out, then pulls her right out. She screams and squirts a cloud of black ink.]

PEARL: [embarrassed] Aw, you guys! You made me ink!

[As Tad and Sheldon begin laughing, Nemo notices something.]

NEMO: What's that?

[Pearl, Sheldon, and Tad then gaze at a dive boat, anchored a hundred feet out. It floats high above on the water's surface.]

TAD: I know what that is ? oh, oh! Sandy Plankton saw one. He said it was called... a butt!

PEARL: Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

[Sheldon surprises the others by suddenly leaping out into the open water.]

SHELDON: Oh, look at me, I'm going to go touch the butt!

[He sneezes, and is propelled further out into the deep. He races back to the edge, as the others laugh.]

SHELDON: Oh yeah? Well, let's see you get closer.

PEARL: Okay. [swims out just a touch farther than Sheldon] Beat that!

[Tad takes the dare even farther. All three look back at Nemo.]

TAD: Come on, Nemo! How far can you go?

NEMO: Oh, um... my dad says it's not safe.

Nemo, no!

-Dad?
-(GRUNTS)

You were about to swim
into open water!

No, I wasn't gonna go.

It was just a good thing I was here.

If I haven't shown up, I don't know...

-Sir, he wasn't gonna go!
-Yeah, he was too afraid!

-No, I wasn't!
-This does not concern you, kids.

And you're lucky I don't tell your parents
you were out there.

You know you can't swim well!

I can swim fine, Dad, okay?

No, it's not okay.
You shouldn't be anywhere near here.

Okay, I was right. You know what?
You'll start school in a year or two.

No, Dad! Just because
you're scared of the ocean...

Clearly, you're not ready and you're not
coming back until you are.

You think you could do these things,
but you just can't, Nemo!

I hate you.

(SINGING) There's...

Nothing to see. Come on, kids.
Gather, uh, over there.

Excuse me, is there anything I do?

I am a scientist.
Uh, is there any problem?

MARLIN: You know, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer... and I just think it's a little too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.

[While they talk, Nemo looks out to the anchored boat, before glaring at his father, as if he is planning on doing omething.]

MR. RAY: Well, I can assure you he's quite safe with me.

MARLIN: Look, I'm sure he is. But you have a large class and he can get lost, you know, from sight if you're not looking. I'm not saying you're not looking ? You're looking...

[Kathy, a gawky little girl fish in the class, points out to the deep.]

KATHY: Oh, my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea!

[Everyone turns to see Nemo in the open water, already half-way out to the anchored boat. He zigzags with slow determined strokes.]

MARLIN: Nemo! What do you think you're doing?

[Marlin rushes to the edge, but is too afraid to go further.]

MARLIN: You're going to get stuck out there, and I'll have to get you before another fish does!

[Nemo ignores him, with his eyes locked on the boat.]

MARLIN: Get back here! I said get back here, now! Stop!

[Nemo stops under the boat and stares back at Marlin.]

MARLIN: You take one more move, mister...

[Nemo holds out his fin.]

MARLIN: D-don't you dare ? If you put one fin on that boat... are you listening to me? DON'T ? TOUCH ? THE ? BOA ?

[Nemo defiantly slaps the bottom of the boat.]

MARLIN: Nemo!

TAD: [whispers] He touched the butt.

[Nemo begins his long swim back to the Drop-off.]

MARLIN: You just paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man. Do you hear me? Big...

[While heading back to the Drop-off, Nemo rolls his eyes at Marlin, when a diver slowly rises up from behind him, with his head filling the entire frame. Everyone sees it ? except Nemo. Marlin opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. Pearl shrieks. Nemo finally looks back to see his reflection in the mask of the diver. He screams in terror.]

NEMO: Daddy!!! Help me!!!

MARLIN: I'm coming, Nemo!

[Marlin breaks from the safety of the reef when another diver rises up, blocking him from Nemo. Mr. Ray scoops up the class, hiding them under his belly, and heads to the bottom of the sea, never to be seen again.]

MR. RAY: Get under me, kids!

[Nemo swims for his life, but a small net snares him and yanks him away.]

NEMO: No, no! Dad!!! Daddy!!!

[The other diver looms over Marlin... a bright flash. The diver has taken a picture. Marlin is temporarily blinded.]

MARLIN: No! Nemo!

[Marlin's blurred image of the scuba divers rising to the surface slowly comes into focus. He lands into a rock wall, and struggles to catch up to them.]

MARLIN: [hysterical] Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo!!! No! No!

[But Marlin is too far away, and is forced to watch the divers exit the water with his son and exit the boat. The engine starts up. Marlin is blown back by the wake of the propellers as the boat pulls away. By the time the turbulence of bubbles dissipates the boat is gone, leaving only a trail of wake. Marlin follows it, but there is no way he'll ever catch up.]

MARLIN: Nemo!!! Nemo!!!

[Above the water, the boat cruises by on the open ocean. The net containing a scared and confused Nemo is dropped into a cooler of seawater. As the diver closes the cooler, the boat hits some chop.]

MAN: Whoa! Hold on!

[The man loses his balance, and knocks his diver's mask overboard. Under the surface, the mask plunges into the ocean and tumbles into the mirk. Meanwhile, Marlin continues to follow the rapidly thinning trail of wake until finally it evaporates completely. He swims back and forth, frantic, trying to find the trail again.]

MARLIN: Oh, no... no. No, it's gone, It's gone ? No, it can't be gone! No, no!

[Marlin takes a deep breath, breaks the surface. The giant ocean swells around him, lifting him up high. But it is gone. He has lost the trail.]

MARLIN: Nemo!!! Nemo!!! Nemo!!! No, no!

[Marlin swims back into the water, before swimming back to the surface.]

MARLIN: Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no!

[Marlin then dives back underwater again, as he spots a row of fish streaming across the ocean floor and races down to them.]

MARLIN: Has anybody seen a boat? Please, a white boat!

[While trying to talk to other fish for help, Marlin is shoved out of the way by a larger fish.]

MARLIN: They took my son! My son! Help me. Please!

DORY: Look out!

[An oncoming blue tang named Dory slams into Marlin as they both scream. He's knocked against a rock, and falls into the sand, dazed.]

DORY: Ow, ow... Oh, oh! Sorry! I didn't see you! [swims down to Marlin] Sir, are you okay?

MARLIN: He's gone... he's gone... no, he's gone...

DORY: There, there. It's alright.

MARLIN: He's gone...

DORY: It'll be okay.

MARLIN: No, no, no... they took him away. I've got ? I have to find the boat. [gets up and begins to swim away]

DORY: [perky] A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat!

[Having been alerted by what Dory just said, Marlin turns back to Dory.]

MARLIN: You have?

DORY: Uh-huh. And it passed by not too long ago.

MARLIN: A white one?

DORY: [puts out a fin] Hi. I'm Dory.

MARLIN: Where? Which way?

DORY: Oh, oh! Oh! It went, um... this way! It went this way! Follow me!

[Dory leads Marlin into deeper waters.]

MARLIN: Thank you. Thank you, thank you so much!

DORY: No problem.

[The two fish go coursing over rifts of sand, with Marlin sticking right behind Dory. As they swim, Dory gradually slows down. Marlin then notices her glancing back, giving him strange looks. She begins to swim faster. More erratic. Marlin has a hard time keeping up. It's almost as if she's trying to lose him.]

MARLIN: Wait!

[Dory hides behind rocks, races through coral, but she can't shake him. Finally, she stops. Faces Marlin.]

DORY: Will you quit it?

MARLIN: What?

DORY: I'm trying to swim here. What, the ocean isn't big enough for you, or something like that?

MARLIN: Huh?

DORY: You got a problem, buddy? Huh, huh? Do ya, do ya, do ya? [postures to fight] You want a piece of me? Yeah, yeah... Ooh, I'm scared now. Wha-a-at!

MARLIN: Wait a minute ?

DORY: Stop following me, okay?

MARLIN: What are you talking about? You're showing me which way the boat went.

DORY: [perky again] A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat! It passed by not too long ago. It went, um... this way! It went this way! Follow me!

[She's off again. Marlin speeds ahead. Blocks her path.]

MARLIN: Wait a minute. Wait a minute! What is going on?! You already told me which way the boat was going!

DORY: I did? [realizes] Oh, no.

MARLIN: If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny! I'm a clownfish!

DORY: No, it's not. I know it's not funny ? I ? I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.

MARLIN: Short-term memory loss. I don't believe this.

DORY: No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family ? well, I mean, at least I think it does... Uh... hmm... Where are they? [thinks, then notices Marlin; smiles] Can I help you?

MARLIN: Something's wrong with you. Really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son.

[Marlin turns to go when he finds himself face to face with a great white shark.]

BRUCE: Hello.

[Marlin doesn't dare move.]

DORY: [cheery] Well, hi!

BRUCE: Name's Bruce.

[The shark juts out a fin. Marlin stays frozen.]

BRUCE: S'alright. I understand. Why trust a shark, right?

[Bruce chomps for effect. Marlin leaps behind Dory. Bruce laughs hard.]

BRUCE: [studies both fish] So... what's a couple of bites like you doin' out so late, eh?

MARLIN: [from behind Dory] Nothing, we're not doing anything, we're not even out.

BRUCE: Great. Then how'd you morsels like to come to a little ? a little get-together I'm having?

DORY: You mean like a party?

BRUCE: Yeah... Yeah, right a party! [chuckles] Waddya say?

DORY: [elbows Marlin] Ooh, I love parties! That like sounds fun!

MARLIN: Y'know parties are fun, and it's tempting, but we can't because ?

[Bruce puts a big fin around each fish, trapping them.]

BRUCE: Aw, come on. I insist.

MARLIN: O-okay, that's all that matters.

[Bruce leads them up and over a rocky ridge into an undersea crater, littered with floating land mines, all moored to the sandy floor with heavy iron chains, making it look like an underwater graveyard.]

DORY: Hey, look! Balloons! It is a party!

BRUCE: [laugh] Mind your distance, though. Those "balloons" can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want one of them to pop.

[Bruce weaves through the minefield. From out the eerie darkness, the haunted wreck of a sunken submarine slowly takes shape. Bruce swims toward a massive hole in the sub's hull that looks into the mess hall.]

BRUCE: [calls out] Anchor! Chum!

[Marlin cringes in horror as he spots a hammerhead shark and a mako shark, swimming anxiously in figure eights inside the wreck. They look out the hole.]

ANCHOR: There you are, Bruce! Finally!

BRUCE: We got company!

ANCHOR: Well, it's about time, mate.

CHUM: We've already gone through all the snacks and I'm still starvin'!

ANCHOR: We almost had to have a feeding frenzy.

CHUM: C'mon, let's get this over with.

[Bruce pushes Marlin and Dory down into the sub, towards the snapping jaws of the other sharks. Marlin covers his eyes. He didn't want to go like this.]

[In the sub mess hall, a shark tail strikes a bell, causing it to ring. Marlin uncovers one eye. Bruce hovers over a sink, which acts as a make-shift podium. It truly is a meeting.]

BRUCE: Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge.

[Bruce, Anchor, Chum, and, surprisingly, Dory all lift their right fins.]

BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM: [in unison] I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food.

ANCHOR: Except stinkin' dolphins.

CHUM: Dolphins. Yeah. They think they’re so cute. [mockingly] Oh, look at me, I'm a flippin' little dolphin. Let me flip for ya'! Ain't I somethin'!

[Anchor and Dory laugh. Marlin doesn't.]

BRUCE: Right then. Today's meeting is "Step Five: Bring a Fish Friend." Now, do you all have your friends?

ANCHOR: Got mine.

[Anchor rises to reveal a quivering little green fish (Blenny) floating under him.]

DORY: [waves] Hey there!

BRUCE: How 'bout you, Chum?

CHUM: Oh... well... I, um... seem to have misplaced my... uh... friend.

[Chum gives a guilty smile, revealing the bones of a fish tail stuck between my teeth, which slightly scares Marlin. He slurps it back into his mouth.]

BRUCE: S'alright, Chum.

[Marlin sees Blenny make break for it. Swims out of the sub unnoticed.]

BRUCE: [continued] I had a feeling this would be a difficult step, you can help yourself to one of my friends.

[Marlin is about to swim out of the sub when Chum grabs him.]

CHUM: Thanks, mate. [hugs Marlin tight] A little chum for Chum, eh?

[Marlin grunts.]

BRUCE: I'll start the testimonies. Hello, my name is Bruce.

ANCHOR/CHUM: Hello, Bruce...

BRUCE: It has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup.

[Anchor and Chum clap.]

CHUM: You're an inspiration to all of us!

ANCHOR: Amen!

[Marlin grunts.]

BRUCE: Right then. Who's next?

DORY: [raises fin] Oh, oh, oh! Pick me! Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!

BRUCE: Yes, the little Sheila down the front.

DORY: Woo!!!

BRUCE: Come on up here.

[As Bruce makes his way toward Anchor and Chum, Dory swims up to the podium.]

DORY: Hi. I'm Dory.

BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM: Hello, Dory...

DORY: And, uh, well... I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.

[Applause.]

CHUM: Hey, that's incredible.

BRUCE: Good on 'ya, mate!

DORY: Phew, I'm glad I got that off my chest.

BRUCE: Alright, anyone else? [notices Marlin] Hello, how 'bout you, mate? What's your problem?

MARLIN: Me? I don't have a problem.

BRUCE: Oh, okay.

BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM: [to each other] Denial.

[Bruce swats Marlin to the podium.]

BRUCE: Just start with your name.

MARLIN: [nervous] Okay... uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish.

CHUM: A clownfish? Really?

BRUCE: Go on, tell us a joke.

CHUM: Oh, I love jokes!

MARLIN: [really nervous] Well, I actually I do know one that's... pretty good. There was this mollusk ? and he walks up to the ? uh, a sea cucumber.

[As Marlin butchers the joke again, the sharks struggle to maintain their grins.]

MARLIN: [continued] Normally they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks... so the sea mollusk says to the cucumber ?

[Marlin goes still and stares at a hole in the roof. Hanging from some bent metal is the diver's mask. The image of the diver, raising his net to catch Nemo, who is calling out his father for help, superimposes over the mask.]

NEMO: [shouts] Daddy!

MARLIN: [under his breath] Nemo...

[Fixated on the mask, Marlin swims past the sharks, and begins making his way toward the hole in the roof.]

CHUM: Nemo! [laughs] Nemo! [straight] I don't get it.

BRUCE: [aside] For a clownfish, he's not that funny.

MARLIN: No, no, no. He's my son... He was taken by... by these divers.

[Marlin continues to make his way toward the hole in the roof.]

DORY: [gasp] Oh my, you poor fish.

[Dory begins following Marlin to the hole in the roof.]

CHUM: Humans. Think they own everything.

ANCHOR: Probably American.

BRUCE: [moved] Now there is a father. Lookin' for his little boy...

[Outside the hole, Marlin inspects the mask, with Dory nearby. He notices writing on the strap.]

MARLIN: Oh, what do these markings mean?

BRUCE: I never knew my father! [bursts into tears]

CHUM: Come here.

ANCHOR: Group hug.

CHUM: We're all mates here, mate.

[Marlin points the writing out to Dory.]

MARLIN: I can't read human!

DORY: Well, then we got to find a fish who can read this! [looks back into sub] Hey look, sharks!

MARLIN: No, Dory!

[Before Marlin can react, Dory scoops up the mask and swims into the sub.]

DORY: Hey guys! Guys, guys, guys ?

[Marlin chases after her. Grabs the mask.]

MARLIN: No, Dory.

DORY: Hey! That's mine!

[A tug of war between Marlin and Dory starts.]

MARLIN: Cut it out!

DORY: Give it back! Gimme!

[The mask rubberbands hard into Dory's face. She clutches her nose.]

DORY: [nasal] Ow!

MARLIN: Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

DORY: Ow. Oh yeah. Ow, ow, ow. Wow, you really clocked me there. [tilts head back] Am I bleeding? Ow, ow...

[She shows Marlin her nose, as a trickle of blood climbs up in the water, like a tiny red ribbon... right under Bruce's nose.]

BRUCE: Dory, are you okay ?

[Bruce sniffs the trickle of blood, as it goes up into his nose much quicker than it normally would. His eyes then shifted into darkness.]

BRUCE: Ooh... that's good!

ANCHOR/CHUM: Intervention!

[Anchor and Chum pin Bruce to the wall, and struggle to hold the great white back.]

BRUCE: Just a bite!

ANCHOR: Now, you hold it together, mate!

CHUM: Remember, Bruce! Fish are friends, not food!

BRUCE: Food!

[Bruce breaks free, and lunges for Marlin and Dory.]

MARLIN: Dory, look out!

[Bruce overshoots them; the two fish swim away with the mask, and escape through through a grate in the floor.]

DORY: Ah!

[Marlin and Dory swim down through the corridor full of piping and duct work. Bruce smashes through the grate.]

BRUCE: I'm having fish tonight!

[Bruce gives chase as Chum and Anchor stick their heads through the hole he's made.]

CHUM: Remember the steps, mate! The steps!

[In the corridor, Marlin and Dory weave through the dark maze with Bruce right on their tails. Their swiftness was enough to keep them ahead of Bruce, but the mask was slowing them down with its mask.]

BRUCE: Just one bite!

[Marlin and Dory shoot up through another grate. Bruce stays in the sub-level below them, his dorsal fin knocking out grates as he goes. The rabid shark smashes through the floor grate onto their level.]

BRUCE: G'day!

MARLIN/DORY: Ah!

[The two fish speed around a cracked open door with ease and swim into the torpedo room, but the bulky Bruce slams into it, knocking it closed. Marlin frantically searches the room for a way to escape.]

MARLIN: There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape!

[Bruce repeatedly slams the door, attempting to go into the torpedo room.]

DORY: [sing-song] Who is it?

MARLIN: Dory, help me find a way out!

DORY: [to Bruce] Sorry. You'll have to come back later. We're trying to escape.

[Another pound. A bolt pops off the door that is beginning to bend inwards...]

MARLIN: There's no way out... there's got to be a way out!

[Dory swims to the top of the room, eyeing a valve handle with the words "ESCAPE HATCH" printed on it.]

DORY: Look, here's something: "es-cap-é." I wonder what that means. It's funny, because it's spelled just like the word "escape."

MARLIN: Let's go!

DORY: Ah!

[Marlin grabs her, and escapes through the hatchway with the mask. Bruce forces his snout through the gap he's made in the doorway.]

BRUCE: HERE'S BRUCEY!!!

[Marlin and Dory swim out of the hatch with the mask, arriving at the top of the submarine. Marlin stops short, having realized something about Dory.]

MARLIN: Wait a minute, you can read?

DORY: I can read? [remembers] That's right, I can read!

MARLIN: [lifts mask] W-well, then here, read this now!

[Bruce bursts through the sub's rusted hull, right under the two fish. His teeth wrench the mask from their fins, where it remains, dangling. The screaming Marlin and Dory are chased down the length of the wreck. Chum and Anchor once again stick their heads through the hole Bruce has made.]

ANCHOR: He really doesn't mean it. You know, he never even knew his father!

CHUM: Don't fall off the wagon!

[At the bow, Marlin and Dory bank a hard right, swimming down into the torpedo tube... loaded with a torpedo.]

MARLIN: Oh, no, it's blocked!

[Bruce slams his snout into the tube, trying to ferret out the fish. He's too big. Anchor and Chum catch up.]

ANCHOR: No, Bruce! Focus!

[Blinded by his hunger, Bruce ignores them and slams his teeth into the tube. Anchor and Chum stick their heads into the opening, between impacts.]

CHUM: Sorry about ? [slam!] ? Bruce, mate. [slam!]

ANCHOR: He's really ? [slam!] ? a nice guy!

[With each slam, the torpedo shakes, but it is held in place by a loose bolt which blocks its path. Marlin stares desperately at the mask, still dangling from Bruce's teeth.]

MARLIN: I need to get that mask!

DORY: You want that mask? Okay!

[Dory pushes in the bolt. The torpedo slides forward, shoving the screaming fish straight into Bruce's mouth. He bites down hard, but his jaws lock on the torpedo.]

MARLIN: Quick, grab the mask! Grab it!

[Together, Marlin and Dory pick up the mask, and safely race back into the torpedo tube. Bruce spits out the torpedo tube in anger.]

ANCHOR: Oh, no.

CHUM: Bruce?

[Bruce quickly snapped out of his primal instincts, with his eyes shifting out of the darkness and back to normal.]

BRUCE: What?

[The sharks indicate the torpedo arcing gracefully towards the minefield.]

BRUCE: Swim away, swim away!

[Bruce, Anchor, and Chum retreat, already knowing what will happen if the minefield was provoked. Dory peeks out of the tube.]

DORY: Aw, is the party over?

[The torpedo simply lands onto a floating mine. It explodes, causing a chain reaction of explosions, shaking everything caught in the waves of heat. Meanwhile, two Australian pelicans sit quietly on the calm surface. A single air bubble, from the explosions deep below, lightly erupts behind one of them.]

PELICAN: [accusingly] Nice...

[The pelican flies off. After some time, Nemo plunges into the water in a whirlwind of bubbles. He lands in plant life. Peeks out, frightened.]

NEMO: Dad??? Daddy?

[Slowly, he backs out of the plants, scanning, wide-eyed... and into ? a trio of giant scary tiki heads! Nemo screams and swims in the opposite direction, but hits a glass wall. Another direction, same result. Turns again - bam! It is revealed that Nemo has been dropped into a fancy marine aquarium, imbedded in the wall of the dentist's office, viewable from both the waiting room and the examining room. Each side of the tank is decorated with a different theme: "Polynesian Island" on one side (complete with a working volcano), and "Pirate Shipwreck" on the other.]

[Nemo looks out the tank at magazines on a table, a woman behind a service window, a toy chest, a Buzz Lightyear action figure, and a Luxo ball: it's a dentist's waiting room. "The Girl from Impanema" plays over tiny speakers.]

Dr. PHILLIP SHERMAN: Barbara, prep for his anterior crown, would ya please, and, uh, I'm going to need a few cotton rolls.

BARBARA: Okay.

[Nemo moves cautiously through the dense plastic brush towards the voices. He stares out at the glass in wonder at a patient seated in a dentist's chair when the dentist's face leans down, right in front of him.]

DR. PHILLIP SHERMAN: Hello, little fella!

NEMO: Ah!

[Spooked, Nemo hides inside a fake plastic barrel.]

Dr. Philip Sherman: [to patient] Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life out on the reef and I saved him... so, that novocaine kicked in yet?

PATIENT: Ifhwinksho. [TRANSLATION: I think so.]

[Nemo backs away from the dentist, only for him to bump into a fake treasure chest. He gasps as the lid opens and bubbles bring forth. Out of the dark interior of a plastic pirate shipwreck, a yellow tang named Bubbles seemingly charges at Nemo.]

BUBBLES: Bubbles!

NEMO: Ah!

BUBBLES: Bubbles! The big bubbles! The little bubbles! My bubbles, all the bubbles!

[The spastic fish grabs at the bubbles, slams the lid shut, and lays on the chest to keep it closed.]

BUBBLES: [protective] My bubbles.

[On the nearby glass, a starfish named Peach unsticks above Nemo. One of her arms flops on his head.]

PEACH: He likes bubbles.

[Nemo shrieks, and hides in a fake miniature diver's helmet. From Nemo's perspective, shadowy fish emerge from their cover and approach the helmet. Hushes. Eerie whispers. Nemo shrinks farther into the helmet, as a pair of eye stalks lower next to him and blink.]

JACQUES: Bonjour.

[Nemo screams, bolts out of the helmet and into the fins of a pufferfish named Bloat. A striped damselfish named Deb, a royal gramma named Gurgle, and Bubbles float around him.]

BLOAT: Slow down, little fella. [laughs] There's nothing to worry about.

DEB: Oh, he's scared to death.

NEMO: I want to go home. Do you know where my dad is?

PEACH: [on the glass] Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.

NEMO: Pet store?

BLOAT: Yeah, you know, like uh... I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

GURGLE: Pet Palace.

BUBBLES: Fish-O-Rama.

DEB: Mail order.

PEACH: eBay.

[Gurgle puts a fin on Nemo.]

GURGLE: So. Which one is it?

NEMO: I'm... from the ocean?

GURGLE: Ah, the ocean. [alarmed] The ocean?!

[Gurgle screams and rips his fin away, clutching it as if it were on fire.]

GURGLE: He hasn't been decontaminated yet! Jacques!

[In a flash, a tiny cleaner shrimp named Jacques zips out of the diver's helmet.]

JACQUES: Oui?

GURGLE: Clean him!

JACQUES: Oui.

[Jacques skitters over to Nemo and perches on top of him.]

GURGLE: Ocean!

JACQUES: Ooh. La Mer. Bon.

[A true professional, Jacques spins Nemo like a cob of corn, cleaning him within seconds. Nemo glows like a lightbulb.]

JACQUES: Voila! He is clean.

[The shrimp zips back into the helmet, pops his mouth, and slams the face plate shut.]

BUBBLES: Wow. The big blue. What's it like?

NEMO: Uh... big... and blue?

BUBBLES: I knew it.

DEB: Kid, if there's anything you need, just ask your auntie Deb, that's me... [Deb points to her reflection] Or, if I'm not around, you can always talk to my sister, Flo. [to "Flo"; with love] Hi. How are you? [to Nemo; conspiratorially] Don't listen to anything my sister says, she's nuts!

PEACH: [muffled] We got a live one!

[The Tank Gang looks up to Peach stuck high on the glass.]

BLOAT: Can't hear ya, Peach.

PEACH: [unsticks] I said we got a live one!

[Excited, the Tank Gang ditch Nemo, and swim up to Peach's level. They look on with keen interest as the dentist begins to work on the patient.]

GURGLE: Yes!

BLOAT: Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

DEB: What do we got?

PEACH: Root canal, and by the looks of those x-rays, it's not going to be pretty.

[The dentist drills a hole into the crown of a tooth within the patient's mouth, causing him to scream in pain.]

BLOAT: Rubber dam and clamp installed?

PEACH: Yep.

GURGLE: What'd he use to open?

PEACH: Gator-Glidden drill. He seems to be favoring that one lately.

[Deb tries to look past her reflection.]

DEB: I can't see, Flo!

PEACH: Uhp, now he's doing the Schilder technique.

BLOAT: Oh, he's using a Hedstrom file.

GURGLE: That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex.

BLOAT: It's got a teardrop cross-section. Clearly a Hedstrom.

GURGLE: No, no. K-Flex.

BLOAT: Hedstrom.

GURGLE: K-Flex!

BLOAT: Hedstrom!

[Bloat suddenly inflates, and lists helplessly away from the group.]

BLOAT: There I go... a little help... over here.

DEB: I'll go deflate him.

[She swims after Bloat. He deflates, with a small wave slightly pushing the plastic plant life like wind.]

DR. PHILLIP SHERMAN: Alright, you can go ahead and rinse.

[The fish watch the patient rinse into the spit tank.]

GURGLE: Oh, the human mouth is a disgusting place!

[Without warning, the pelican Nigel bounces off the window by the tank. The fish don't react. Keep their eyes on the dentist. Nigel thrusts his head into the room, out of breath.]

PEACH: Hey Nigel.

NIGEL: What did I miss? Am I late?

PEACH: Root canal, and it's a doozy.

NIGEL: Root canal, huh? What did he use to open?

PEACH: Gator-Glidden drill.

NIGEL: He's been favoring that one. Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the secondary portal terminus... [spots Nemo] Hello. Who's this?

DEB: New guy. [chuckles]

GURGLE: The dentist took him off the reef.

NIGEL: An outie? From my neck of the woods, eh? Sorry if I ever took a snap at ya! Fish got to swim, birds got to eat!

DR. PHILLIP SHERMAN: Hey!

[The dentist is heading for the window, waving the bird way.]

DR. PHILLIP SHERMAN: No, no, no, no! Those aren't your fish. They're my fish. Come on! Go. Go on. Shoo! Shoo!

[Nigel takes off, knocking over a framed photo. The dentist picks up the frame, only to see that the glass on the frame has cracked.]

DR. PHILLIP SHERMAN: Aw, the picture broke. [shows the patient] This here's Darla. She's my niece. 'going to be eight next week. [shows Nemo in the tank] Hey, little fellah, say hello to your new mummy. She's going to be here Friday to pick you up. You're her present. Oh, shhshhshh! It's our little secret!

[The dentist places the picture on the counter by the tank, and heads for the bathroom.]

DR. PHILLIP SHERMAN: Well, Mr. Tucker, while that sets up I'm going to go see a man about a wallaby.

[The fish swim over to the picture.]

BLOAT: Oh, Darla.

NEMO: What? What's wrong with her?

GURGLE: She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

[Close up on the frame, which is of Darla, a cute little girl in ponytails. She smiles through her bracers, holding a plastic bag with a goldfish. The goldfish is belly-up. DEAD.]

BUBBLES: Poor Chuckles.

DEB: [bursts into tears] He was her present last year!

BLOAT: Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.

[We hear a flush. The fish look across to the dentist emerging from the bathroom, revealing the toilet.]

PEACH: She's a fish killer!

[Nemo begins to panic, swimming out of control.]

NEMO: I can't go with that girl, I have to get back to my dad!

[He passes too close to the filter, and is sucked into the end of the intake tube. Plugs it up.]

NEMO: [grunts] Daddy!!! Help me!!!

TANK GANG: Oh, no...He's stuck...Oh, boy...

[The fish rush to get him out...]

GILL: Nobody touch him.

[...but instantly freeze on command. From behind a plastic skull, a moorish idol, Gill, glides into view. The majestic fish's dorsal and pelvic fins seem to extend the full height of the tank. A commanding presence. He stares intensely at Nemo.]

GILL: [quiet] Nobody touch him.

[Calmly, Gill approaches the filter and stares Nemo down, considering his situation. His intentions unreadable.]

NEMO: [struggles; small voice] Can you help me?

GILL: No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out.

DEB: But, Gill ?

GILL: [sharp] I just wanna see him do it, okay? [to Nemo] Calm down. Now, alternate wiggling your fins and your tail.

NEMO: [panicked] I-I can't. I have a bad fin.

GILL: Never stopped me.

[Gill turns to reveal his severed pectoral fin. Nemo gasps at the sight of it.]

GILL: Just think about what you need to do.

[This time Nemo concentrates, and tries again. All of the fish look on with rapt attention. Can he do it? Nemo struggles, winces... and surprises himself by popping free from the tube.]

GILL: Perfect.

TANK GANG: Yay! He's out...He made it...alright!

[Peach notices Gill studying the filter.]

PEACH: Wow, from the ocean. Just like you, Gill.

GILL: [distracted] Yeah.

PEACH: [chuckles] I've seen that look before. What are you thinkin' about?

GILL: I'm thinkin'... tonight, we give the kid a proper reception.

[The exuberant tank fish surround Nemo.]

BLOAT: So kid, you got a name or what?

NEMO: Nemo. I'm Nemo.

[Cut to morning. Marlin, asleep, lies inside the diver's mask, his face squashed against the lenses of the mask. Dory lies next to him, snoring loudly.]

MARLIN: [mumbles] Nemo...Nemo...Nemo...

DORY: [in her sleep] You going to eat that?...

[Slowly, the camera pulls wide to reveal the mask hanging like a hammock from a shard of metal protruding from the sub's bow. The explosions from the night before have dislodged the entire wreck, which now balances precariously over a massive abyss.]

DORY: Careful of that hammer...

[Marlin opens his eyes, and finds himself looking straight down into the dark depths below. He jumps back, sees the diver's mask, and touches the writing... before the sub shifts slightly.]

MARLIN: [under breath] The mask! What does it say? What does it say? Dory!

DORY: That sea monkey has my money...

[Marlin shakes her.]

MARLIN: Wake up! Get up! Come on! Get up!

DORY: Yes, I'm a natural blue...

MARLIN: Get up!

[Dory jumps awake, unknowingly taking the mask with her. It hangs off her back like a saddle.]

DORY: [blabbering] Aagh! Look out! Sharks eat fish! What? Who is it? Aagh!

[Dory's broad actions do the trick, and the sub slides full boar off the cliff... straight towards the two fish. The screaming fish swim for it, but run right into the opposing rock wall... too late. The sub slams into the rock wall, consuming the fish in an explosion of dust. As it settles, Marlin is shocked to find himself and Dory still alive, spared by inches.]

DORY: [coughs] Wow. Dusty.

[Marlin notices something is missing.]

MARLIN: [gasps] The mask. Where's the mask?

[They look down just in time to see the mask disappear completely into darkness. Marlin dives down after it.]

MARLIN: No! No, no, the mask! Get it! Get the mask, get the mask! Get it!

[The second Marlin enters the inky black, he backpedals to a more visible depth. Clings to the trench wall, spooked. Dory swims jauntily past, humming.]

DORY: Woo-hoo!

[Marlin watches her disappear into the darkness...]

DORY: [scatting] It just keeps going on, doesn't it? Echo! Echo!

[and then pop back up next to him.]

DORY: Hey. Watch you doing?

MARLIN: It's gone. I've lost the mask.

DORY: What'd you drop it?

MARLIN: You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son, now it's gone!

[All Dory sees is a sad clownfish, and that just won't do. She makes a pouty face.]

DORY: Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills... when life gets you down, you know what you got to do?

MARLIN: I don't wanna know what you got to do.

DORY: [sings] Just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, swimming, swimming, what do we do, we swim, swim.

[Dory takes Marlin by the fin, and gently leads him down to the abyss.]

MARLIN: Dory, no singing.

DORY: [opera singing] Ho ho-ho ho-ho-ho! I love to swim! When you want to swim you want to keep on swimming ?

MARLIN: See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song! Now it's in my head!

DORY: Sorry.

[Slowly, everything goes black.]

MARLIN: Dory, do you see anything?

DORY: Ah! Something's got me!

MARLIN: That was me. I'm sorry.

DORY: Who's that?

MARLIN: Who's that? Who could it be? It's me!

DORY: Are ? are you my conscience?

MARLIN: Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?

DORY: Can't complain.

MARLIN: Good. Now Dory, I want you to tell me: do you see anything?

DORY: I see a... I see a light.

MARLIN: A light?

[A tiny bright light appears, hovering alone in the darkness.]

DORY: Yeah. Over there. Hey conscience, am I dead?

MARLIN: No, I see it too.

[Marlin and Dory swim into the glow of the light. It is simply a small glowing orb, floating by itself. The orb is mesmerizing. It's almost as if Marlin and Dory are under a spell.]

MARLIN: What is it?

DORY: It's so... pretty...

MARLIN: I...I'm feeling happy...which is a big deal...for me.

DORY: I want to touch it.

[She reaches out. The orb comes to life, dancing like a fairy.]

DORY: Oh!

MARLIN: Hey...Come back...Come on back here.

[The orb rises. They follow it.]

DORY: I'm going to getcha...

MARLIN: I'm going to get you.

DORY: I'm going to getcha...

MARLIN: I'm going to swim with you.

DORY: I'm going to getcha!

MARLIN: I'm going to be your best friend ?

[A large anglerfish silently fades into view. It is horrifying. A prehistoric creature, with huge fangs, and lifeless eyes. The "orb" is attached to the tip of a long antenna that juts from its forehead. It was bait, Marlin and Dory fell for it.]

MARLIN: Good feeling's gone.

[The lights on the anglerfish turn on, but not before it roars! Marlin and Dory scream. The anglerfish chomps at them, but not before they swim away. It chases the two of them, who only have the glow of its antenna to navigate by.]

MARLIN: I can't see! I don't know where I'm going!

DORY: Ah!

[Suddenly, the light shines over the diver's mask, now resting on a rock. Upon spotting the mask, Marlin stops.]

MARLIN: The mask!

[Dory bumps into Marlin.]

DORY: What mask?

[He pulls her down just as the shrieking anglerfish shoots past them, leaving them in the pitch black.]

DORY: Okay, I can't see a thing.

[As they fumble in the dark, the anglerfish turns towards the two fish, having heard Dory. The beam from its light swings onto them.]

MARLIN: Oh, gee!

DORY: [sees mask] Hey, look, a mask!

MARLIN: Read it!

[Marlin plays decoy, leading the anglerfish away as it roars. Its jaws snap right behind him. Once again, Dory is left in the dark.]

DORY: Uh... I'm sorry, but if you could just bring it a little closer... I kind need that light.

[Marlin lures the beast back to Dory. Light falls on her and the mask.]

DORY: That's great. Keep it right there.

MARLIN: Just read it!!

[The anglerfish's jaws snap right behind Marlin again.]

DORY: Okay, okay! Mr. Bossy. [reads] Uh...P... Okay, P. Sher-r-r...Sher... P. Sher-r...P. Shirley...P. Sherrr...

[Marlin ducks down into the safety of a small trench formed by two rocks. The anglerfish tries to ferret him out, but can't fit. Marlin grabs onto its light, and aims it at Dory.]

DORY: Oh! The first line's "P. Sherman!"

MARLIN: P. Sherman doesn't make any sense ? !

[Still holding from the antenna, Marlin is yanked from the rocks.]

DORY: Okay, uh... Second line... "42..."

MARLIN: Ah! Don't eat me, don't eat me ?

[The anglerfish swallows Marlin. Everything goes dark...]

DORY: Light, please!

[The anglerfish's stomach lights up. Marlin's silhouette shakes inside, still holding onto the antenna. The anglerfish spits him out, and lunges for him, but bites down on his own antenna. As it roars in pain, Marlin rushes over to Dory. The anglerfish, now furious, gains its bearings, and barrels straight at them.]

DORY: Wa ? Walla ? Walla-by...Wallaby Way...The second line's "42 Wallaby Way!"

MARLIN: That's great. Just finish up here. Speed read.

DORY: Sssss...sid ?

MARLIN: [eyes on anglerfish] Take a guess. No pressure, no pressure ? Well, there's a lotta pressure! Pressure! Take a guess! Now! With pressure!

DORY: "Sydney!" "Sydney!" It's "Sydney!"

MARLIN: Duck!

[In one swift move, Marlin lifts up the face plate of the diver's mask, closes his eyes, and lets the anglerfish crash onto him. Dory screams. There is a blinding flash!]

MARLIN: I'm dead. I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I died, I'm dead.

[Marlin opens his eyes. The anglerfish is wedged tight between the mask and the rock. Flaps around helplessly. Marlin gets into the creature's face.]

MARLIN: Woohoo! [sings] We did it. We did it. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. No eating here tonight ? woo! ? Eating here tonight.

[Dory appears from behind the rock. Sees Marlin celebrating. Doesn't remember why, but joins in anyway.]

DORY: No, no, no, eating here tonight! You on a diet ?

MARLIN: Dory! Dory! So what'd it say? What did the mask say?

DORY: [automatic] "P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney." [stops; gasps] I remember what it said! I usually forget things, but I remembered it that time. "P. Sherman, 42 ? "

MARLIN: W-wait! Now where is that?

DORY: I don’t know. But who cares? Ha-ha! I remembered!

[The pissed-off anglerfish roars; Marlin and Dory scream, and take off towards the surface.]

DORY: "P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney!" I remembered it again!

[Fade into the dentist's office, which is closed up for the night. The rotating red glow of the tank's fake volcano illuminates everything. In the tank, Nemo sleeps soundly inside a plastic Tiki hut. From out of the dark, a pebble strikes him. Nemo doesn't wake. Then another pebble strikes him.]

JACQUES: Psst. Nemo! [louder] Nemo...

[Nemo is pummeled by a barrage of pebbles. He jumps awake.]

NEMO: Ah!

[The tiny shrimp figure of Jacques stands in the entranceway of the hut.]

JACQUES: Suivez-moi.

[Jacques swims off, but Nemo just floats there, confused. Jacques pokes his head back into the Tiki hut.]

JACQUES: Follow me.

[Nemo is led through the plastic underbrush to the center of the tank. The mood is eerie and somber. No one speaks. Tribal chanting can be heard as they near the base of the volcano. Rising from behind the Tiki heads are Bubbles, Gurgle, and Bloat, the source of the chanting. Jacques begins the long climb up the face of the volcano with Nemo nervously in tow. Halfway up the mountainside, Deb and Peach hold fake kelp fronds, and ceremoniously whack Nemo as he passes. Jacques continues to lead him up to the peak of the volcano where Gill waits, silent and stern. A wimpy stream of bubbles continuously ]

BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE: [chanting] Hoo!

GILL: State your name.

NEMO: Nemo.

GILL: Brother Bloat, proceed.

BLOAT: Nemo! Newcomer of orange and white, you have been called forth to the summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tank-hood.

NEMO: Huh?

PEACH: We want you in our club, kid.

NEMO: Really?

BLOAT: If you are able to swim through...The Ring of Fire! Turn on the Ring of Fire! The Ring of Fire, you said you could do it the Ring of Fire.

BUBBLES: Bubbles! Bubbles! Let me...

ALL: [chanting]

PEACH: Isn’t there another way? He’s just a boy!

ALL: [speed up chanting]

GILL: From this moment on, you will now be known as Sharkbait.

ALL: Sharkbait! Ooh-ha-ha!

GILL: Welcome, brother Sharkbait!

ALL: Sharkbait!

GILL: Enough with the Sharkbait.

GURGLE: Sharkbait!

GILL: OK, Sharkbait’s one of us now, agreed?

ALL: Agreed!

GILL We can’t send him off to his death. Darla’s coming in 5 days, so what are we going to do? I’ll tell you what we’re going to do: we’re going to get him outta here. We’re going to help him escape.

NEMO: Escape? Really?

GILL: We’re all going to escape!

GURGLE: Gill, please, not another one of your escape plans.

DEB: Sorry, but they, they just, they never work.

BLOAT: Yeah. Why should this be any different?

GILL: Cause we’ve got him.

NEMO: Me?

GILL: You see that filter?

NEMO: Yeah?

GILL: You’re the only one who can get in and out of that thing. What we need you to do is take a pebble inside and jam the gears. You do that and this tank’s going to get filthier and filthier by the minute. Pretty soon, the dentist’ll have to clean the tank himself. And when he does, he’ll take us out of the tank, put us in the individual baggies, then we roll ourselves down the counter, out of the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the street and into the harbor! It’s foolproof! Who’s with me?

BLOAT: I...

JACQUES I...

DEB: I...

BUBBLES: I...

GURGLE: I think your nuts.

GILL: [sighs]

GURGLE: No offense kid, but, you’re not the best swimmer.

GILL: He’s fine, he can do this. So Sharkbait, what do you think?

NEMO: Let’s do it.

DORY I’m going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where are you going? I’m going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. If you’re asking where I’m going. I’ll tell you that’s where I’m going. It’s P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where? I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way…

MARLIN: Excuse me. Hi. Do you know how to get to hello? Wait! Can you tell me... Hey! Hold it! Wait a minute! I’m trying to talk to you. OK, fellas, come back here. Please, one quick question. I need to and they’re gone again. [sighing]

DORY: P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I’ll tell you again. I don’t get tired of it...

MARLIN: OK, all right. Here’s the thing. You know, I just, think it’s best if I just, if I just, carry on from here by myself.

DORY: OK.

MARLIN: You know, alone.

Without, well, I mean, not without you. I mean, it’s just that I don’t want you, with me.

DORY: Huh?

MARLIN: I don’t want a hurt your feelings..

DORY: You want me to leave?

MARLIN: Well, I mean not. Yes. Yeah. It’s just that you know I just can’t afford anymore delays and you’re one of those fish that cause delays. And sometimes it’s a good thing. There’s a whole group of fish. They’re delay fish.

DORY: You mean... You mean you don’t like me?

MARLIN: No, of course I like you. It’s because I like you I don’t want a be with you. It’s a complicated emotion.

DORY: [sobbing and crying]

MARLIN: Don’t cry. I like you.

MOONFISH LEADER: Hey, you! Lady, is this guy bothering you?

DORY: I don’t remember. Were you?

MARLIN: No. We’re just, we’re..hey, do you guys know how I can get to...

MOONFISH: Look, pal. We’re talking to the lady, not you. Hey, you like impressions?

OK. Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen. So, what are we? Take a guess.

DORY: I’ve seen one of those.

MOONFISH: I’m a fish with a nose like a sword.

DORY: Wait, wait...

MARLIN: It’s a swordfish.

MOONFISH: Hey, clown boy! Let the lady guess. Where’s the butter?

DORY: It’s on the tip of my tongue.

MARLIN: [coughs] Lobster. What?

MOONFISH: Saw that. Lots of legs, lives in the ocean.

DORY: Clam!

MOONFISH: Close enough. [singing] It’s a whale of a tale, I’ll tell you lad, a whale of a tale.

DORY: They’re good.

MARLIN: Will somebody please give me directions?

MOONFISH: [mockingly] Will somebody please give me directions?

DORY: [laughing]

MARLIN: I’m serious.

MOONFISH: Blah-blah-blah! Me-me-blah! Blah-blah-blah-blah-me-me-me!

MARLIN: Thank you.

DORY: Oh, dear. Hey, come back! What’s the matter?

MARLIN: What’s the matter? While they’re doing their silly little impressions, I am miles from home, with a fish that can’t even remember her own name.

DORY: Boy, bet that’s frustrating.

MARLIN: Meanwhile my son is out there.

DORY: You’re son Chico? Right. Got it.

MARLIN: Nemo! But it doesn’t matter, ‘cause no fish in this entire ocean is going to help me.

DORY: Well, I’m helping you. Wait right here. Hey, guys.

MOONFISH: What, is he bothering you again?

DORY: No, he’s a good guy. Go easy on him, he’s lost his son, Fabio. Any of you heard of P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

MOONFISH: Sydney? Sure. Why, Ted here’s got relatives in Sydney. Don’t you, Ted?

TED: Sure do.

DORY: They know Sydney! You wouldn’t know how to get there, would you?

MOONFISH: What you wanna do is follow the EAC, that’s the East Australian Current. Big current, can’t miss it, it’s in..that direction. And then you got to follow that for about, I don’t know, what do you guys think? About three leagues? And that little baby’s going to put you right past Sydney.

ALL: Ta-da!

MARLIN: Great! That’s great! Dory, you did it!

DORY: Oh, please. I’m just your little helper. Helping along, that’s me.

MARLIN: Well, listen fellas, thank you.

MOONFISH: Don’t mention it. And, loosen up. OK, buddy?

DORY: You guys. You really nailed him. Bye.

MOONFISH: Ma’am, one more thing.

DORY: Yes.

MOONFISH: When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.

DORY Trench, through it, not over it. I’ll remember. Hey, wait up, partner. Hold on. Wait! Wait-wait! I got, I got to tell you something. Whoa. Nice trench. Hello! [echoing] OK, let’s go.

MARLIN: Bad trench. Come on, we’re going to swim over this thing.

DORY: Partner. Little red flag going up. Something telling me we should swim through it, not over it.

MARLIN: Are you even looking at this thing? It’s got death written all over it.

DORY: I’m sorry, but I really, think we should swim through.

MARLIN: And I’m really done talking about this. Over we go.

DORY: Come on, trust me on this.

MARLIN: Trust you?

DORY: Yes, trust. It’s what friends do.

MARLIN: Look! Something shiny!

DORY: Where?

MARLIN: It just swam over the trench. Come on, we’ll follow it.

DORY: OK. Boy, sure is clear up here.

MARLIN: Exactly. And look at that, there’s the current. We should be there in no time.

DORY: Hey, little guy.

MARLIN: You wanted to go through the trench.

DORY: I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my Squishy. Come here, little Squishy. [Baby talking] Ow.

MARLIN: Dory! That’s a jellyfish!

DORY: Bad Squishy!

MARLIN: Shoo! Get away! Come here, let me see.

DORY: Don’t touch it!

MARLIN: I’m not going to touch it. I just want a look.

DORY: How come it didn't sting you?

MARLIN: It did. It’s just that, hold still. I live in this anemone and I’m used to these kind of stings. Come here. It doesn’t look bad, you’re going to be fine. But now we know, don’t we? That we don’t want a touch these again. Let’s be thankful this time it was just a little one. Don’t move! This is bad, Dory.

DORY: Watch this! Boing! Boing!

MARLIN: Dory!

DORY: You can’t catch me!

MARLIN: Dory! Don’t bounce on the tops! They will not sting you! The tops don’t sting you, that’s it!

DORY: Two in a row, beat that.

MARLIN: Dory! All right, listen to me. I have an idea, a game.

DORY: A game?

MARLIN: A game. Yes.

DORY: I love games! Pick me!

MARLIN: All right, here’s the game. Whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish, wins.

DORY: OK!

MARLIN: Rules! You can’t touch the tentacles, only the tops.

DORY: Something about tentacles, got it. On your mark, get set, go!

MARLIN: Wait! Wait! Not something about them, it’s all about them! Wait! Dory!

DORY: got to go faster if you want a win!

MARLIN: Dory!

DORY Boing! Boing!

MARLIN: Wait a minute Dory!

DORY: Whee!

MARLIN: So, we’re cheating death now. That’s what we’re doing. We’re having fun at the same time. I can do this, just be careful.

DORY: Careful I don’t make you cry when I win!

MARLIN: I don’t think so!

DORY: Give it up, old man. You can’t fight evolution, I was built for speed.

MARLIN: The question is, Dory, are you hungry?

DORY: Hungry?

MARLIN: Yeah. Cause you’re about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The clownfish is the winner! We did it! We’re going to... Dory? Oh, no. Dory! Dory! Dory! Dory! [sizzling] [Marlin screaming]

DORY: [weakly] Am I disqualified?

MARLIN: No, you’re doing fine! You’re, you’re actually winning! But you got to stay awake. Where does P. Sherman live?

DORY: P.Sherman.. Wallaby Way…Sydney…

MARLIN: That’s it! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake!

DORY: P. Sherman..

MARLIN: [weakly] Awake…

DORY: ..42 Wallaby Way…Sydney.

MARLIN: Awake…wake up…Nemo…

Gill: You miss your Dad, don’t you, Sharkbait?

Nemo: Yeah.

Gill: Well, you’re lucky to have someone out there who’s looking for you.

Nemo: He’s not looking for me. He’s scared of the ocean.

GILL: Peach, any movement?

PEACH: He’s had at least four cups of coffee, it’s got to be soon.

GILL: Keep on him. My first escape, landed on dental tools. I was aimin’ for the toilet.

NEMO: Toilet?

GILL: All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

NEMO: Wow. How many times have you tried to get out?

GILL: I’ve lost count. Fish aren’t meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to ‘ya.

BUBBLES: [giggles] Bubbles!

PEACH: Potty break! He just grabbed the Reader’s Digest! We have 4.2 minutes.

GILL: That’s your cue, Sharkbait.

BLOAT: You can do it, kid.

GILL: You got to be quick. Once you get in, you swim down to the bottom of the chamber and I’ll talk you through the rest.

NEMO: OK.

GILL Go on, it’ll be a piece of kelp.

NEMO: [takes a deep breath]

GILL: Nicely done! Can you hear me?

NEMO: Yeah.

GILL: Here comes the pebble. Now, do you see a small opening?

NEMO: Uh-huh.

GILL: OK, inside it you’ll see a rotating fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning. Careful, Sharkbait.

NEMO: I can’t do it!

PEACH: Gill, this isn’t a good idea.

GILL: He’ll be fine. Try again.

NEMO: OK!

GILL: That’s it, Sharkbait. Nice and steady.

NEMO: I got it! I got it!

BLOAT: He did it!

GILL: That’s great, kid! Now, swim up the tube and out.

NEMO: Oh, no! Gill!

GILL: Sharkbait!

BLOAT: Oh,my gosh!

GILL: Get him out of there!

BUBBLES: Help him!

GURGLE: What do we do? What do we do?

PEACH: Oh, no!

GILL: Stay calm, kid! Just don’t panic!

NEMO: Help me!

GILL: Sharkbait! Grab hold of this!

NEMO: No! No!

GILL: Feed me more!

GURGLE: That’s it!

GILL: Come on, Sharkbait! Grab it!

NEMO: [grunts] I got it!

GILL: Pull!

[all panting]

PEACH: Gill, don’t make him go back in there.

GILL: No. We’re done.

NEMO: [whimpering]

CRUSH: Dude. Focus, dude. Dude. He lives! Hey, dude!

MARLIN: [groaning] What happened?

CRUSH: Oh, saw the whole thing, dude. First you were like, ‘whoa’! And then we were all like, ‘whoa’! And then you were like, ‘whoa’.

MARLIN: What are you talking about?

CRUSH: You, mini-man. Taking on the jellies. You got serious thrill issues, dude. Awesome.

MARLIN: Oh, my stomach. [moans]

CRUSH: Oh, man. No hurling on the shell, dude, just waxed it.

MARLIN: So, Mr. Turtle…

CRUSH: Dude. Mr. Turtle is my father. Name’s Crush.

MARLIN: Crush? Really? OK, Crush, listen I need to get to the East Australian Current. EAC?

CRUSH: [chuckles] Dude, you’re riding it, dude! Check it out! OK, grab shell, dude!

MARLIN: Grab what?! [screaming]

CRUSH: Righteous! Righteous! Yeah!

MARLIN: Stop!

CRUSH: So, what brings you on this fine day to the EAC?

MARLIN: Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney. [gasps] Dory! Is she all right?!

CRUSH: Little Blue. She is sub-level, dude.

MARLIN: Dory, Dory! Dory! Oh, Dory.

[Dory muttering]

I’m so sorry. This is all my fault.

DORY: 29, 30! Ready or not, here I come! There you are! Catch me if you can! [laughing]

SQUIRT; Whoa!

MARLIN: Oh, my goodness!

CRUSH: Kill the motor, dude. Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.

SQUIRT: Whoa! That was so cool! Hey Dad, did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did?

CRUSH: You so totally rock, Squirt! So give me some fin, noggin.

BOTH: Dude

CRUSH: Intro. Jellyman, Offspring. Offspring, Jellyman.

SQUIRT: Jellies?! Sweet.

CRUSH: Totally.

MARLIN: Well, apparently, I must’ve done something you all likes dude.

SQUIRT: You rock, dude.

MARLIN: Ow.

CRUSH: Curl away, my son. It’s awesome, Jellyman. Little dudes are just eggs, leave ‘em on the beach to hatch, then coo-coo-ca-choo, they find their way back to the big ‘ol blue.

MARLIN All by themselves?

CRUSH: Yeah.

MARLIN: But, dude . How do you know when they’re ready?

CRUSH: Well, you never really know. But when they’ll know, you’ll know, you know?

[laughter]

DORY: Hey! Look, everybody!

SQUIRT: I know that dude. It’s the Jellyman.

DORY: Well, go on, jump on him.

TURTLE KIDS: Turtle pile!

MARLIN: Wait, kids.

TURTLE KID 1: Are you funny?

TURTLE KID 2: Where’s your shell?

MARLIN: Hold on, I need to breath...

TURTLE KID 3: Are you running away?

TURTLE KID 4: Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?

TURTLE KID 5: Did they sting you?

MARLIN: One at a time!

TURTLE KID 6: Mr. Fish, did you die?

DORY: Sorry. I was a little vague on the details.

SQUIRT: So where are you going?

MARLIN: Well, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me.

ALL: [kids gasping]

DORY: No way.

SQUIRT: What happened?

MARLIN: No, kids. I don’t want a talk about it.

KIDS: Come on. Please?

SQUIRT: Please?

MARLIN: Well, OK. I live on this reef, a long long way from here.

DORY: Oh, boy. This is going to be good, I can tell.

MARLIN: And my son, Nemo, see he was mad at me. Maybe he wouldn’t have done it if I hadn’t been so tough on him, I don’t know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when he was out there, these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast. So we swam out in the ocean to follow them…

TURTLE KID: They couldn’t stop them. And then Nemo’s dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into..

SMALL FISH: three ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowing them up!

BIG FISH: Golly, that’s amazing!

SMALL FISH: And then dives thousands of...

LOBSTER: feet straight down into the dark. It’s like wicked dark down there, you can‘t see a thing. How’s it going, Bob? And the only thing that they can see down there..

SWORDFISH: ...is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man. And then he has to blast his way…

DOLPHIN: So, these two little fish have been... Searching the ocean for days. On the East Australian Current.

FEMALE BIRD: Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney..

MALE BIRD 1: Harbor in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like this guy’s going to stop at...

MALE BIRD 2: nothing until he finds his son. I sure hope he makes it.

MALE BIRD 3: That’s one dedicated father if you ask me.

SEAGULLS: Mine! Mine! Mine!

NIGEL: Would you just shut up?! You’re rats with wings!

PELICAN 2: ..bloke’s been looking for his boy Nemo.

NIGEL: Nemo?!

PELICAN: He was taken off the reef by divers and this..

NIGEL: There, take it! You happy!

GULLS: Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

NIGEL: Say that again! You said something about Nemo. What was it?

GULLS Mine! Mine! Mine!

CRAB: [growls] [karate yells]

GULL: Mine!

PELICAN: Last I heard, he’s heading towards the harbor.

NIGEL: Brilliant!

NEMO: [sighs]

DEB: Is he doing OK?

GURGLE: I don’t know, but whatever you do, don’t mention D-A-R..

NEMO: It’s OK, I know who you’re talking about. Gill? Gill?

GILL: Hey, Sharkbait.

NEMO: I’m sorry I couldn’t stop the...

GILL: No, I’m the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that ocean. I was willing to put you in harm’s way to get there. Nothing should be worth that. I’m sorry I couldn’t get you back to your father, kid.

NIGEL: All right! Hey, hey!

Dr. Philip Sherman: What the?!

PATIENT: [screams]

Dr. Philip Sherman: Well, that’s one way to pull a tooth. [laughs] Darn kids. Well, good thing I pulled the right one, prime minister?

NIGEL: Psst!

PEACH: Nigel. You just missed an extraction.

NIGEL: Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet.. What I’m talking about?! Nemo! Where’s Nemo? I got to speak with him.

NEMO: What? What is it?

NIGEL: Your dad’s been fighting the entire ocean looking for you.

NEMO: My father? Really?

GILL: Really?

NIGEL: Oh, yeah. He’s travelled hundreds of miles. He’s been battling sharks and jellyfish and all sorts of...

NEMO: Sharks? That can’t be him.

NIGEL: Are you sure? What was his name? Some sort of sportfish or something: tuna, uh, trout...

NEMO: Marlin?

NIGEL: That’s it! The little clownfish from the reef.

NEMO: It’s my dad! He took on a shark!

NIGEL: I heard he took on three.

ALL: Three?!

GILL: Three sharks?

BLOAT: That’s got it be 4,800 teeth!

NIGEL: You see, kid, after you were taken by diver Dan over there, your dad followed the boat you were on like a maniac.

NEMO: Really?

NIGEL: He’s swimming and he’s swimming and he’s giving it all he’s got and then three gigantic sharks capture him and he blows them up! And then dives thousands of feet and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock and what does he get for a reward? He gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest! And now he’s riding with a bunch of sea turtles on the East Australian Current and the word is he’s headed this way right now, to Sydney!

BLOAT: Wow!

DEB: Oh, what a good daddy!

GILL: He was looking for you after all, Sharkbait.

GURGLE: He’s swimming to the filter!

BLOAT Not again!

GILL: Sharkbait!

DEB: No!

GURGLE: You’ve got your whole life ahead of you!

BLOAT: Oh, no!

GILL: We’ll help you, kid!

BLOAT: got to get him out!

DEB: Give me that thing!

Get him out of there!

GURGLE: Come on, kid! Grab the end!

[jam gears]

DEB: Sharkbait!

BLOAT: Sharkbait! Are you OK!

GURGLE: No!

GILL: Can you hear me, Sharkbait! Nemo!

NEMO: Yeah, I can hear you.

GILL: Sharkbait, you did it!

GURGLE: Sharkbait, you’re, covered with germs!

GILL: That took guts, kid. All right, gang. We have less than 48 hours before Darla gets here. This tank’ll get plenty dirty in that time but we have to help it along any way we can. Jacques!

JACQUES Oui!

GILL: No cleaning.

JACQUES I shall resist.

GILL: Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We’re going to make this tank so filthy, the dentist’ll have to clean it.

BLOAT: [burps]

GILL: Good work.

CRUSH: All right, we’re here, dudes! Get ready! Your exit’s coming up, man!

MARLIN: Where?! I don’t see it!

DORY: Right there! I see it! I see it!

MARLIN: You mean the swirling vortex of terror?!

CRUSH: That’s it, dude!

MARLIN: Of course it is.

CRUSH: OK, first: find your exit buddy! Do you have your exit buddy?

DORY: Yes!

CRUSH: OK, Squirt here will now give you a rundown of proper exiting technique!

SQUIRT: Good afternoon, we’re going to have a great jump today! OK, crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall! There’s a screaming bottom turn, so watch out! Remember: rip it, roll it and punch it!

MARLIN: It’s like he’s trying to speak to me, I know it! You know, you’re really cute! But I don’t know what you’re saying! Say the first thing again!

CRUSH: OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!

DORY: Whoo!

MARLIN: That was fun! I actually enjoyed that!

DORY: Hey, look! Turtles!

CRUSH: Most excellent! Now, turn your fishy tails ‘round and swim straight on through to Sydney! No worries, man!

MARLIN: No worries! Thank you, dude Crush!

KIDS: Bye! Bye, Jellyman!

CRUSH: You tell your little dude I said ‘hi’, OK?

SQUIRT: See you later, dudes!

DORY: Bye, everyone!

MARLIN: Nemo, would’ve loved this. Crush, I forgot! How old are you?

CRUSH: 150, dude! And still young! Rock on!

MARLIN: 150. 150, I got to remember that.

DORY: Whoa. We going in there?

MARLIN: Yep.

DORY: P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

MARLIN: Yep. We’re going to just swim straight.

DORY: [singing] Just keep swimming, just keep swimming. [humming]

MARLIN: Dory? Boy, this is taking a while.

DORY: How about we play a game?

MARLIN: OK.

DORY: OK I’m thinking of something, orange. And it’s small...

MARLIN: It’s me.

DORY: Right. OK, orange, and small...

MARLIN: It’s me.

DORY: All righty, Mr. Smarty Pants. Orange and small, and white stripes...

MARLIN: Me. And the next one’s just a guess: me.

DORY: OK, that’s just scary.

MARLIN: Wait, I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we’ve passed it before and that means we’re going in circles and that means we’re not going straight!

MARLIN We got to get to the surface, come on! Let’s figure it out up there. Let’s go! Follow me! What?

DORY: Hey! Relax. Take a deep breath. [both inhaling and exhaling] Now, let’s ask somebody for directions.

MARLIN: Fine. Who do you wanna ask, the speck? There’s nobody here!

DORY: Well, there has to be someone. It’s the ocean, silly, we’re not the only two in here. Let’s see…OK, no one there. Nope. Nada. There’s somebody. Hey! Excuse me.

MARLIN: Dory! OK, now it’s my turn. I’m thinking of something dark and mysterious. It’s a fish we don’t know. And if we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out our bones!

DORY: What is it with men and asking for directions?

MARLIN: Look, I don’t wanna play the gender card right now. You wanna play a card? Let’s play the ‘Let’s Not Die’ card.

DORY: You want a get outta here, don’t you?

MARLIN: Of course, I do. But, Dory you don't fully understand. [sighs] All right.

DORY: Well then, how are we going to do that unless we give it a shot and hope for the best? Come on, trust me on this. Excuse me! Little fella? Hello. Don’t be rude, say ‘hi’.

MARLIN: Hello.

DORY: His son Bingo..

MARLIN: Nemo.

DORY: .. was taken to,

MARLIN: Sydney.

DORY: Sydney. Yes. And it’s really, important that we get there as fast as we can. So can you help us out? Come on, little fella. Come on.

MARLIN: Dory, I’m a little fella. I don’t think that’s a little fella.

DORY: Oh, a big fella. Big... A whale... okay, Maybe he only speaks whale. [imitating the sound a whale makes] MwOOooo! WwwwEEEE... nEEeeeedd tOOooo FINNND hiIIiiss SONNNNN...!

MARLIN: Dory? What are you doing? Are you sure you speak whale?

DORY: CaaaAAAaaN yoooOOOOu... mMm...giIIIVe uuuus dirRECtiooons?

MARLIN: Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying! See, he’s swimming away.

DORY: CoooOOOOOOme bAAAAAAAack!!

MARLIN: He’s not coming back. You offended him.

DORY: Maybe a different dialect. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOAAAAAAAAAA..!

MARLIN: Dory. Dory, this is not whale. You're speaking like..upset stomach.

DORY: Maybe I should try humpback.

MARLIN: No, don’t try humpback.

DORY: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOO! WAAAAAAAAAOOOOOO!

MARLIN: Okay, you actually sound sick.

DORY: Maybe louder, huh? RAAAH!!! RAAAAH!!!!!!

MARLIN: Don’t do that!

DORY: Too much orca. Didn’t it sound a little orca-ish?

MARLIN: It doesn't sound orca! It sounds like nothing I've ever heard!

DORY: MOOOO! ..MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.

MARLIN: It’s just as well, he might be hungry.

DORY: Don’t worry. Whales don’t eat clownfish, they eat krill.

KRILL: Swim away!

DORY: Look. Krill.

MARLIN: Move, Dory! Move!

(Marlin and Dory now get trapped inside the whale's mouth)

Gill: Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. And it’s all thanks to you, kid. You made it possible.

(Nemo chuckles)

Gill: Jacques, I said no cleaning!

JACQUES: I am ashamed.

PEACH: Look. Scum angel.

GURGLE: [whimpering]

BUBBLES: Bubbles! I love the bubbles! [coughing]

DEB: Flo! Has anybody seen, Flo?

PEACH: 9:00, and cue dentist.

Dr. Philip Sherman: Hello, Barbara. Sorry, I’m late.

PEACH: OK. Here we go.

Dr. Philip Sherman: Little Davey Reynolds.

PEACH: Walks to the counter, drops the keys..

GURGLE: Bloat, that’s disgusting!

BLOAT: Tastes pretty good to me. [burps]

GURGLE: Don’t you people realize we are swimming in our own--

PEACH: Shh! Here he comes.

Dr. Philip Sherman: What the?

(the fish hide)

Dr. Philip Sherman: Crikey, what a state. Oh. Barbara, what’s my earliest appointment tomorrow?

BARBARA: 10:00, love.

Dr. Philip Sherman: Leave it open, would you? I got to clean the fish tank before Darla gets here.

GILL: Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

NEMO: Yay! He’s going to clean the tank! He’s going to clean the tank! We’re going to be clean!

GILL: Are you ready to see your dad kid?

NEMO Uh-huh.

GILL: Of course you are. I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s out there in the harbor waiting for you right now.

NEMO: Yeah.

MARLIN: [yelling and shouting]

DORY: [Dory laughing] Whoo! Here comes a big one! Come on, you got to try this!

MARLIN: Would you. Just. Stop it?!

DORY: Why? What’s wrong?

MARLIN: We’re in a whale! Don’t you get it?!

DORY: A whale?

MARLIN: A WHALE! ‘Cause you had to ask for help! And now we’re stuck here!

DORY: A whale. You know I speak whale.

MARLIN No, you’re insane! You can’t speak whale! I have to get out! I have to find my son! I have to tell him how old. Sea. Turtles are!

DORY: [whooping] Hey. You OK? There, there. It’s all right. It’ll be OK.

MARLIN: No, it won’t.

DORY: Sure it will, you’ll see.

MARLIN: No. I promised him I’d never let anything happen to him.

DORY: Huh. That’s a funny thing to promise.

MARLIN: What?

DORY Well, you can’t never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him... Not much fun for little Harpo.

(the whale stops. Marlin and Dory noticed that)

MARLIN: What’s going on?

DORY: Don’t know. I’ll ask him. [moos]

Marlin: Dory... Dory?

Dory: What's going on?

[whale roars]

DORY: I think he says we’ve stopped.

MARLIN: Of course, we’ve stopped. Just stop trying to speak whale, you’re going to make things worse. What is that noise?

[whale growling]

MARLIN: Oh, no. Look what you did. The water’s going down! It’s going down!

DORY: Really? You sure about that?

MARLIN: Look, it’s already half-empty!

DORY: Hmm. I’d say it’s half full.

MARLIN: Stop that! It’s half-empty!

(the whale roars)

DORY: OK, that one was a little tougher. He either said we should go to the back of the throat or he wants a root beer float.

MARLIN: Of course he wants us to go there! That’s. Eating us! How do I taste, Moby? Huh? Do I taste good?! You tell him I’m not interested of being lunch!!

DORY: OK. He...

MARLIN: STOP TALKING TO HIM!!

(the whale's tongue goes up, making Marlin and Dory fall, they grab the taste buds)

Marlin: What is going on?!

DORY: I’ll check! What..

MARLIN: No! No more whale! You can’t speak whale!

DORY: Yes, I can!

MARLIN: No, you can’t! You think you could do these things but you can’t, Nemo!

[roaring and whistling]

DORY: OK.

(Dory lets go)

MARLIN: Dory!

(Marlin grabs Dory)

DORY: He says it’s time to let go! Everything’s going to be all right!

MARLIN: How do you know?! How do you know something bad isn’t going to happen?!

DORY: I don’t!

BOTH: [Dory and Marlin screaming]

MARLIN: [cackles] We’re alive!

DORY: Look! Sydney. Sydney! Sydney! Sydney again!

MARLIN: You were right, Dory! We made it! We’re going to find my son! Thank you, sir.

DORY: Wow. I wish I could speak whale.

MARLIN: OK. All we got to do is find the boat that took him.

DORY: Right!

MARLIN: Come on, Dory. We can do this!

PEACH: [yawns] Morning. It’s morning, everyone! Today’s the day! The sun is shining, the tank is clean and we are getting out of... [gasps] The tank is clean. The tank is clean!

DEB: But how?

GILL: Boss must’ve installed it last night while we were sleeping.

NEMO: What’re we going to do?

GILL: What’s it say, Peach?

PEACH: [muffled]

GILL: I can’t hear you, Peach.

PEACH: The AquaScum 2003 is an all-purpose, self-cleaning… maintenance free salt water purifier… that is guaranteed to even extend the life of your aquarium fish.

BLOAT: Stop it!

PEACH: The AquaScum is programmed to scan. Your tank environment every five minutes?!

GURGLE: Scan? What does that mean?

AQUASCUM: Temperature, 82 degrees. P-H balance normal.

ALL: Ooh.

PEACH: Nice.

GURGLE: Curse you, Aquascum!

BLOAT: That’s it for the escape plan. It’s ruined!

Nemo: Then what’re we going to do about--

ALL: Darla!!!

GILL: Stay down, kid!

BLOAT: False alarm.

GURGLE: My nerves can’t take much more of this.

BLOAT: What’re we going to do when that little brat gets here?

GILL: I’m thinking, I’m thinking.

NEMO: Gill! Help me!

GILL: Hold on! I’m coming! Swim down! Come on, kid! Swim down!

BLOAT: Everybody jump in!

DEB: Swim down!

GILL: That’s it!

Dr. Philip Sherman: What the?!

ALL: Yay!

GILL: Good work!

NEMO: Gill!

BLOAT: Sharkbait!

GILL: Roll, kid! Lean! Lean! Go to the window.

NEMO: [grunting]

Dr. Philip Sherman: Whoops. That would’ve been a nasty fall.

NEMO: Gill! Don’t let me go belly up!

GILL: Just calm down, Nemo.

NEMO: Don’t let me go belly up!

GILL: You won’t go belly up, I promise. You’re going to be okay.

ALL: Darla!!!

DORY: All right, do any of these boats look familiar to you?

MARLIN: No, but the boat has to be here somewhere! Come on, Dory. We’re going to find it.

DORY: I’m totally excited. [yawns] Are you excited?

MARLIN: Dory, wake up. Come on.

DORY: Duck!

MARLIN: That’s not a duck. It’s a pelican! No! I didn’t come this far to be breakfast!

GERALD: [gagging]

PELICAN: Hey, Nigel. Would you look at that?

NIGEL: What?

PELICAN 1: Sun’s barely up and already Gerald’s had more than he can handle.

NIGEL: Yeah. Reckon somebody oughta help the poor guy.

PELICANS: Yeah, right.

NIGEL: Well, don’t everybody fly off at once.

GERALD: [retches]

NIGEL: All right, Gerald, what is it? Fish got your tongue? Love a duck!

MARLIN: I got to find my son Nemo!

NIGEL: Nemo? Hey, he’s that fish! Y’know the one we were talking about! The one that’s been fighting the whole ocean! Hey, I know where your son... Wait! Come back! Stop!

MARLIN: Keep going! He’s crazy!

NIGEL: I got something to tell you!

SEAGULL: Mine.

NIGEL: OK. Don’t make any sudden moves. Hop inside my mouth if you want to live.

MARLIN: Hop in your mouth? And how does that make me live?

SEAGULL: Mine?

NIGEL: Because I can take you to your son.

MARLIN: Yeah, right.

NIGEL: No. I know your son. He’s orange, he’s got a gimpy fin on one side..

Marlin: THAT'S NEMO!!!

SEAGULLS Mine! Mine! Mine!

NIGEL: Fasten your seatbelts!

SEAGULLS: Mine! Mine! Mine!

DORY: Whoo-hoo!

NIGEL: Everybody hold on!

SEAGULLS: Mine! Mine! Mine!

[fish screams]

BUBBLES: Too loud! Too loud for me!

DARLA: [singing] Twinkle, twinkle little star!

PEACH: Find a happy place. Find a happy place! Find a happy place!

BARBARA: Darla, you’re uncle will see you now.

Dr. Philip Sherman: All right, let’s see those pearly whites.

DARLA: [roars] I’m a piranha. They’re in the Amazon.

Dr. Philip Sherman: And a piranha’s a fish, just like your present.

DARLA: [giggling] I get a fishy! Fishy!

Dr. Philip Sherman: Oh, no. Poor little guy.

BLOAT: He’s dead!

GILL: Sharkbait!

DARLA Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!

Dr. Philip Sherman: Must’ve left your present in the car, sweetie. I’ll go and get it.

GILL: He’s still alive!

PEACH He’s not dead!

BLOAT: What’s happening? Why is he playing dead?

GILL: He’s going to get flushed down the toilet! He’s going to get outta here!

BLOAT: He’s going to get flushed!

GURGLE: What a smart little guy!

GILL: No, not the trash can!

BUBBLES: Nemo! No!

NIGEL: Hey. Hey, I found his dad!

MARLIN: Where’s Nemo! Where is he?!

BLOAT: Dentist! Dentist!

GILL: He’s over there!

MARLIN: What’s a "dentist? What is that? Nigel, get in there!

NIGEL: I can’t go in there.

MARLIN: Oh, yes you can. [Marlin grabs Nigel's tongue] Charge!

DARLA: [screaming]

Dr. Philip Sherman: What the… Darla, sweetie, look out! Steady. Hold still! Easy! Hold still! It's all right. Nobody’s going to hurt you!

[heart beating]

MARLIN: Nemo.

DORY: Oh, my goodness.

Dr. Philip Sherman: Gotcha! Keep down.

MARLIN: Nemo!

NEMO: Daddy?

Dr. Philip Sherman: Out with you. And stay out!

NEMO: Daddy!

DARLA: Fishy? Fishy! Wake up! Wake up!

DEB: Oh, no!

GILL: Quick! To the top of Mt. Wannahockaloogie!

DARLA: Why are you sleeping?!

PEACH: Hurry!

GILL: Bloat! Ring of Fire!

DARLA: Fishy! [screaming]

Dr. Philip Sherman: Crikey? All the animals have gone mad! [grunts]

DARLA: [Darla screams] Get it out!

GURGLE: Smack her in the head!

BLOAT: Go, Gill!

DARLA: Fish in my hair!

NEMO: Gill.

GILL: Sharkbait. Tell your dad, I said hi.

NEMO: Aah!!!

GILL: Go get him.

Dr. Philip Sherman: [groans]

BLOAT: He did it!

BUBBLES: I’m so happy!

GURGLE: Is he going to be OK, Gill?

GILL: Don’t worry. All drains lead to the ocean.

DARLA: Fishy!

NEMO: [screaming] Daddy!!! [whimpers]

[ahoy ringing]

NIGEL: I’m... I’m so sorry. Truly, I am.

DORY: Hey...

MARLIN: Dory. If it wasn’t for you, I never even would have made it here. So, thank you.

DORY: Hey, wait a minute. Wait! Where are you going?

MARLIN: It’s over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo’s gone and I’m going home now.

DORY: No. No, you can’t! Stop! Please don’t go away. Please? No one’s ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave, if you leave…I just, I remember things better with you. I do. Look, P. Sherman, 42..! Ugh! I remember it, I do. It’s there, I know it is because when I look at you, I can feel it. And, I look at you and… I’m home. Please. I don’t want them to go away. I don’t want to forget.

MARLIN: I’m sorry, Dory, but I do.

CRAB 1: Manna from heavens!

CRAB 2: Sweet nectar of life!

BOTH: Hey!

CRAB 1: This is our spot!

CRAB 2: Go on! Get outta here!

BOTH: Hey!

CRAB 1: Yeah, that’s it fella! Just keep on swimming, you got that!

CRAB 2: Too right, mate! I got a live one here!

NEMO: Have you seen my Dad?

CRAB 2: Gotcha! Come back here!

CRAB 1: You let him go!

NEMO: Dad! Dad! Dad!

DORY: No! [groans]

NEMO: Excuse me. Are you all right?

DORY: No! I don’t know where I am! I don’t know what’s going on, I think I lost somebody but I can’t remember.

NEMO: It’s OK. I’m looking for someone too. We can look together.

DORY: [sniffles] I’m Dory.

NEMO: I’m Nemo.

DORY: Nemo? That’s a nice name.

NEMO: Dad!

DORY: Dad!

NEMO: Dad!

DORY: Dad! Wait a minute, is it your dad or my dad?

NEMO: My dad.

DORY: Got it. Dad!

NEMO: Where are we, anyway?

DORY: Dad! Dad! Oh. Syl-shi Sydney. "P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney." Nemo! It’s you! You’re Nemo!

NEMO: Yes! Yes! I’m Nemo!

DORY: Oh! You’re Nemo! You were dead! I saw you! And then I, here you are! I found you! You’re not dead! And your father! Your father!

NEMO: My father? You know my father?! Where is he?

DORY: This way! He went this way! Quick!

BOTH: Hey!

DORY Hey! Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks just like him!

NEMO: But bigger!

Bernie: Yeah, I saw I'm, Bluey! But I’m not telling you where he went. And there’s no way you’re going to make me!

(Dory get furious at Bernie. She puts Bernie out in the surface, the seagulls notice)

SEAGULLS: Mine.

Bernie: [screams] All right! I’ll talk! He went to the fishing grounds! [shrieks]

FISH: Hey! Look out!

MARLIN: Sorry. Just trying to get home.

NEMO: Dad! Dad!

MARLIN: Nemo?

NEMO: Daddy!

MARLIN: Nemo?

NEMO: Dad!

DORY: Nemo’s alive!

MARLIN: Dory? Nemo!

NEMO: Daddy!

MARLIN: Nemo! I’m coming!

NEMO: Dad!

MARLIN: Nemo!

NEMO: Dad!

MARLIN: Thank goodness! It’s all right, son. It’s going to be OK.

FISH 1: Turn around! You’re going the wrong way!

DORY: Aah!!! Look out!

MARLIN: Move!

FISH: [fish shouting and screaming]

DORY: Help!!! [Dory screaming]

MARLIN: Dory!

NEMO: Come on! Dory!

DORY: Help!!! Get us out! [screams]

MARLIN: No! Dory!

NEMO: Dad! I know what to do!

MARLIN: Nemo! No!

NEMO: We have to tell all the fish to swim down together!

MARLIN: Get out of there, now!

NEMO: I know this will work!

MARLIN: No, I am not going to lose you again!

NEMO: Dad, there’s no time! It’s the only way we can save Dory! I can do this!

MARLIN: You’re right. I know you can.

NEMO: Lucky fin!

MARLIN: Now go! Hurry!

NEMO: Tell all of the fish to swim down!

MARLIN: Well?! You heard my son! Come on!

NEMO: Dory! We have to tell everybody to...

MARLIN ...Swim down together! Do you understand what I’m saying to you?! Swim down!

DORY: Everybody swim down!

NEMO: Come on! You have to swim down!

DORY: Swim down, OK?

MARLIN: Down! Swim down! Swim down! Swim down!

[fish gasping]

Marlin: Don’t give up! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming! That's it!

NEMO: It’s working!

ALL: Keep swimming!

MARLIN: Just keep swimming! Keep swimming!

NEMO: Come on, Dad!

MARLIN: You’re doing great, son!

NEMO: That’s my Dad!

MARLIN: Come on! Let’s get to the bottom! Keep swimming!

DORY: [singing] Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.

MARLIN: Almost there! Keep swimming!

ALL: Keep swimming! Keep swimming! [cheering]

MARLIN: Dory! Where’s Nemo!

DORY: There!

MARLIN: Oh, no. Nemo!

NEMO: [moaning]

MARLIN: Nemo? Nemo? It’s OK. Daddy’s here, daddy’s got you.

NEMO: [coughs] Daddy?

MARLIN: Oh, thank goodness.

NEMO: Dad, I don’t hate you.

MARLIN: Oh, no, no, no. I’m so sorry, Nemo. Hey, guess what?

NEMO: What?

MARLIN: Sea turtles? I met one! And he was a 150 years old.

NEMO: 150?

MARLIN: Yep.

NEMO: ‘Cause Sandy Plankton said they only live to be a 100.

MARLIN: Sandy Plankton? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean and not know as much as Sandy Plankton! He was a 150! Not 100! Who is this Sandy Plankton who knows everything wrong?

Marlin: Time for school! Get up! Let’s go! Go! I’m going to win!

NEMO: No, you’re not! I did it!

MARLIN: My own son beats me!

MR. RAY: Climb aboard, explorers!

MARLIN: So just then, the sea cucumber looks over to the mollusk and says: With fronds like these, who needs anemones?

(Bob, Ted and Bill laugh at this)

MR. RAY: Well, hello, Nemo! Who’s this?

NEMO: Exchange student.

SQUIRT: I’m from the EAC, dude!

MR. RAY: Sweet.

BOTH: Totally.

Bob: But seriously, Marty, did you really do all the things you say you did?

BRUCE: Pardon me.

ALL: [all gasping]

BRUCE: Hello. Don’t be alarmed.

(Ted inks)

ANCHOR: We just wanna make sure that our newest member got home safe.

DORY: Thanks, guys.

BRUCE: Well, see you next week.

CHUM: Keep up with the program, Dory.

DORY: Not food! Bye!

MR. RAY: Hold on! Here we go! Next up, knowledge!

MARLIN: Bye, son! Have fun!

NEMO: Bye, Dad! Oh! Oh, Mr. Ray! Wait. I forgot something. Love you, Dad.

Dr. Philip Sherman: Barbara?

BARBARA: Uh-huh?

Dr. Philip Sherman: I don’t understand it. Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee and it breaks! I had to clean the tank myself, take all the fish out, put ‘em in bags and... Where’d the fish go? [car horns honking]
